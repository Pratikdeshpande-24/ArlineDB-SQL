# Airline Database Exploratory Project

## Project Overview
In this exploratory project, we leveraged the Airline Database to conduct a comprehensive analysis. We developed intermediate to advanced-level SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the data. 

## Techniques and Tools
The project employed a variety of SQL functions and techniques, including:
- **Joins**: To combine data from different tables.
- **Ranking Functions**: For ordering and ranking results.
- **Aggregation and Grouping**: To summarize and group data effectively.
- **Data Extraction Methods**: To retrieve and manipulate specific data.

These techniques were used in conjunction to thoroughly analyze and interpret the dataset.
